# Password_Strength_Checker

# Description:

This is a **simple command-line program** written in Rust that **checks the strength of a password**. 
It evaluates the password based on several criteria, including *length*, the *presence of lowercase and uppercase letters*, *numbers*, and *special characters*. 
The program determines whether the password is strong enough to **resist common hacking techniques** or if it should be strengthened.

# How it works:
The program prompts the user to **enter a password** in the console. 
It then checks the password *against the predefined criteria*, including the *length of at least 25 characters*, the *presence of lowercase and uppercase letters*, *numbers*, and *special characters*. 
After the evaluation, it **provides feedback** to the user, indicating whether the password is **strong or weak**. 
The user can use this information to *create a stronger*, more secure password if necessary.
